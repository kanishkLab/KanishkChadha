## Introduction

Code reviews are one of the most valuable practices in software development—when done well. But too often they become:
- A bottleneck that slows delivery
- A source of conflict and frustration
- A checkbox exercise that catches nothing

This guide covers how to make code reviews genuinely effective.

## The Purpose of Code Review

Before optimizing the process, align on why you're doing reviews:

### Primary Goals

1. **Catch bugs and issues** before they reach production
2. **Share knowledge** across the team
3. **Maintain code quality** and consistency
4. **Mentor and grow** team members

### Secondary Goals

- Document decisions (PR descriptions become documentation)
- Spread ownership (multiple people understand each change)
- Enforce standards (automated where possible)

## As an Author

### Before Requesting Review

**Self-review first**. Read through your own diff as if you were the reviewer. You'll catch obvious issues and save everyone time.

**Write a good PR description**:
- What problem does this solve?
- Why this approach?
- What alternatives did you consider?
- How can the reviewer test this?

**Keep PRs small**. Aim for < 400 lines of changes. Large PRs get superficial reviews.

```
# Bad: "Implement user authentication"
# 2000 lines, touches 50 files

# Good: Break into smaller PRs
# 1. "Add password hashing utility" (100 lines)
# 2. "Create user model and repository" (150 lines)
# 3. "Implement login endpoint" (200 lines)
# 4. "Add session management" (150 lines)
```

**Make it easy to review**:
- Separate refactoring from behavior changes
- Include relevant tests
- Add comments explaining non-obvious decisions

### Responding to Feedback

**Assume good intent**. Written feedback can sound harsher than intended.

**Don't take it personally**. The review is about the code, not you.

**Explain your reasoning**. If you disagree, explain why. Maybe you have context the reviewer doesn't.

**Know when to defer**. Not every battle is worth fighting. Sometimes it's better to make the change and move on.

## As a Reviewer

### Mindset

**Be kind**. There's a human on the other end who worked hard on this code.

**Be constructive**. Don't just point out problems—suggest solutions.

**Be timely**. Respond within a few hours if possible. Blocked PRs kill momentum.

### What to Look For

**Correctness**
- Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Are there potential bugs?

**Design**
- Is this the right approach?
- Does it fit with the existing architecture?
- Is it over-engineered or under-engineered?

**Readability**
- Can you understand the code without the author explaining it?
- Are names clear and descriptive?
- Is the code well-organized?

**Maintainability**
- Will this be easy to modify in the future?
- Are there tests?
- Is it documented where necessary?

### What NOT to Focus On

**Style nitpicks**. Use automated formatters and linters instead.

**Personal preferences**. "I would have done it differently" isn't useful feedback unless there's a concrete reason.

**Perfection**. Good enough is good enough. Don't block PRs for minor improvements.

### Giving Feedback

**Be specific**. Point to the exact line and explain the issue.

```
# Bad
"This function is confusing"

# Good
"The name `process()` doesn't indicate what's being processed. 
Consider `validateUserInput()` to make the purpose clear."
```

**Distinguish severity**. Make it clear what's blocking vs. optional:

- 🔴 **Blocker**: Must fix before merging
- 🟡 **Suggestion**: Would improve the code, but not required
- 💭 **Question**: Seeking to understand, not necessarily requesting changes
- 🎨 **Nitpick**: Minor style preference, feel free to ignore

**Offer alternatives**. Don't just say what's wrong—show what could be better.

```
# Instead of
"This is inefficient"

# Try
"This loops through the array twice. You could combine the 
operations into a single pass:

```typescript
const { valid, invalid } = items.reduce(...)
```"
```

## Team Practices

### Set Expectations

Document your team's code review standards:
- Expected turnaround time
- What requires review (all changes? just production code?)
- Who can approve (anyone? specific reviewers?)
- What's blocking vs. non-blocking

### Automate What You Can

Don't waste human attention on things machines can check:
- Formatting (Prettier, Black)
- Linting (ESLint, Pylint)
- Type checking (TypeScript, mypy)
- Test coverage
- Security scanning

### Rotate Reviewers

Avoid having the same person review all PRs:
- Spreads knowledge across the team
- Prevents bottlenecks
- Exposes everyone to different parts of the codebase

### Review Review Quality

Periodically assess:
- Are reviews catching bugs?
- Are they taking too long?
- Is feedback constructive?
- Are people learning from reviews?

## Common Anti-Patterns

### The Rubber Stamp

Approving without really reading. Usually caused by:
- PRs that are too large
- Time pressure
- Trust without verification

**Fix**: Require meaningful comments on approvals.

### The Gatekeeper

One person who must review everything and blocks on minor issues.

**Fix**: Distribute review responsibility. Set clear standards for what's blocking.

### The Nitpick Factory

Reviews that focus entirely on style and minor issues while missing real problems.

**Fix**: Automate style checks. Focus review time on logic and design.

### The Ghost Town

PRs that sit for days without review.

**Fix**: Set SLAs. Make review time visible. Celebrate fast reviews.

## Measuring Effectiveness

Track these metrics:
- **Time to first review**: How long until someone looks at a PR?
- **Time to merge**: Total time from PR creation to merge
- **Review iterations**: How many rounds of feedback?
- **Bugs caught**: Issues found in review vs. production

## Conclusion

Effective code review is a skill that takes practice. The goal isn't perfection—it's continuous improvement of both the code and the team.

Focus on:
- Small, well-described PRs
- Timely, constructive feedback
- Automation for style and formatting
- A culture of learning, not gatekeeping

When done well, code reviews become one of the most valuable activities your team does—not just for code quality, but for knowledge sharing and team growth.
