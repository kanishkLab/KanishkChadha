## Introduction

"We need to take the site down for maintenance" is a phrase that should be extinct in 2024. Yet I still see teams scheduling downtime for database migrations that could be done safely online.

This guide covers the patterns I use to migrate databases without downtime, even for tables with millions of rows.

## The Golden Rule

**Never make a change that's incompatible with the currently running application code.**

This means migrations happen in multiple phases:
1. Deploy code that works with both old and new schema
2. Run the migration
3. Deploy code that only works with new schema
4. Clean up (optional)

## Safe Operations

These operations are generally safe to run without downtime:

### Adding a Nullable Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN middle_name VARCHAR(100);
```

This is safe because:
- Existing code doesn't know about the column (ignores it)
- New code can handle NULL values

### Adding an Index Concurrently

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

The `CONCURRENTLY` keyword is crucial—without it, the table is locked during index creation.

### Adding a New Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  preferences JSONB
);
```

New tables don't affect existing code.

## Dangerous Operations

These require careful handling:

### Renaming a Column

**Wrong way** (causes downtime):
```sql
ALTER TABLE users RENAME COLUMN name TO full_name;
```

**Right way** (zero downtime):

1. Add new column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN full_name VARCHAR(200);
```

2. Deploy code that writes to both columns:
```typescript
await db.query(
  'UPDATE users SET name = $1, full_name = $1 WHERE id = $2',
  [name, userId]
);
```

3. Backfill existing data:
```sql
UPDATE users SET full_name = name WHERE full_name IS NULL;
```

4. Deploy code that reads from new column, writes to both

5. Deploy code that only uses new column

6. Drop old column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN name;
```

### Adding a NOT NULL Constraint

**Wrong way**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL;
```

This scans the entire table and locks it.

**Right way**:

1. Add a check constraint (doesn't lock):
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_email_not_null 
  CHECK (email IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;
```

2. Validate the constraint (scans but doesn't lock):
```sql
ALTER TABLE users VALIDATE CONSTRAINT users_email_not_null;
```

3. Convert to NOT NULL (instant, uses existing constraint):
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT users_email_not_null;
```

### Changing Column Type

**Wrong way**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ALTER COLUMN amount TYPE DECIMAL(10,2);
```

**Right way**: Same pattern as renaming—add new column, migrate data, switch over.

## Large Table Migrations

For tables with millions of rows, even "safe" operations need care.

### Batched Backfills

Never update millions of rows in one transaction:

```typescript
async function backfillInBatches(batchSize = 1000) {
  let processed = 0;
  
  while (true) {
    const result = await db.query(`
      UPDATE users 
      SET full_name = name 
      WHERE id IN (
        SELECT id FROM users 
        WHERE full_name IS NULL 
        LIMIT $1
      )
      RETURNING id
    `, [batchSize]);
    
    processed += result.rowCount;
    console.log(`Processed ${processed} rows`);
    
    if (result.rowCount < batchSize) break;
    
    // Small delay to reduce load
    await sleep(100);
  }
}
```

### Monitoring During Migrations

Watch these metrics:
- Database CPU and I/O
- Replication lag
- Query latency
- Lock wait times

## Testing Migrations

### Local Testing

1. Dump production schema (not data)
2. Apply migration locally
3. Run application tests

### Staging Testing

1. Restore recent production backup to staging
2. Run migration
3. Verify application works
4. Check migration duration

### Production Dry Run

For critical migrations:
```sql
BEGIN;
-- Run migration
-- Check results
ROLLBACK;
```

## Rollback Strategy

Always have a rollback plan:

1. **Additive changes**: Usually don't need rollback (new columns are ignored)
2. **Data migrations**: Keep old column until confident
3. **Destructive changes**: Have a restore plan

## Real Example: Adding a Foreign Key

We needed to add a foreign key from `orders` to `customers` on a table with 50M rows.

**Approach**:

1. Add constraint without validation:
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customer 
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id) 
NOT VALID;
```

2. Validate in batches during low-traffic period:
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders VALIDATE CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customer;
```

**Result**: Zero downtime, completed in 45 minutes during normal traffic.

## Tools and Automation

### Migration Linters

Use tools that catch dangerous patterns:
- [strong_migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations) (Ruby)
- [squawk](https://github.com/sbdchd/squawk) (PostgreSQL)

### Deployment Integration

Make migrations part of your deployment pipeline:
1. Run migrations before deploying new code
2. Verify migrations succeeded
3. Deploy new application code

## Conclusion

Zero-downtime migrations require more planning and multiple deployments, but the payoff is worth it. Your users don't experience interruptions, and you can deploy with confidence at any time.

The key principles:
- Never break compatibility with running code
- Make changes in small, reversible steps
- Test thoroughly before production
- Monitor during and after migrations

Start treating database changes with the same care as application code, and "scheduled maintenance" becomes a thing of the past.
