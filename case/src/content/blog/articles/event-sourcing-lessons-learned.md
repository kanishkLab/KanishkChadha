## Introduction

Event sourcing is one of those architectural patterns that sounds amazing in theory but can be challenging in practice. After running an event-sourced payment system in production for 2 years, I've learned when it's worth the complexity and when it's not.

## What is Event Sourcing?

Instead of storing the current state of your data, event sourcing stores a sequence of events that led to that state. Think of it like a bank statement: instead of just showing your current balance, it shows every transaction that got you there.

## The Good Parts

### Complete Audit Trail

This is the killer feature. When a customer reports a payment issue, I can replay every event and see exactly what happened. No more "I don't know why the system did that."

### Time Travel Debugging

Being able to replay events up to a specific point in time is incredibly powerful for debugging. I can reproduce production issues locally by replaying the event stream.

### Flexibility in Projections

Need a new view of your data? Just create a new projection and replay the events. No complex database migrations required.

## The Hard Parts

### Complexity

Event sourcing adds significant complexity. You need to think about:
- Event versioning and schema evolution
- Eventual consistency
- Projection rebuilding
- Event store performance

### Eventual Consistency

Your projections are eventually consistent with the event stream. This can be confusing for developers used to immediate consistency.

### Debugging is Different

When something goes wrong, you can't just look at the database. You need to understand the event stream and projections.

## When to Use Event Sourcing

Based on my experience, event sourcing is worth it when:

1. **Audit trail is critical**: Financial systems, healthcare, compliance-heavy domains
2. **Complex business logic**: When you need to understand how you got to the current state
3. **Multiple views of data**: When different parts of the system need different representations

## When NOT to Use Event Sourcing

Don't use event sourcing for:

1. **Simple CRUD applications**: The complexity isn't worth it
2. **Prototypes or MVPs**: Start simple, add complexity later if needed
3. **When the team isn't ready**: Event sourcing requires a mental shift

## Practical Tips

### Start Small

Don't event-source your entire system. Start with one bounded context where the benefits are clear.

### Invest in Tooling

Build good tooling for:
- Viewing events
- Replaying events
- Monitoring projection lag
- Event versioning

### Plan for Schema Evolution

Events are immutable, but your business logic will change. Plan for event versioning from day one.

## Conclusion

Event sourcing is a powerful pattern, but it's not a silver bullet. Use it when the benefits (audit trail, time travel, flexibility) outweigh the complexity. For most applications, traditional state-based storage is simpler and sufficient.

The key is understanding the trade-offs and making an informed decision based on your specific requirements.
