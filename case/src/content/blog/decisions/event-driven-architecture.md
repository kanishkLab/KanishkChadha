title: "Adopting Event-Driven Architecture for Order Processing"
description: "Migration from synchronous order processing to event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka to decouple services, improve resilience, and enable scalability."
type: decision
publishDate: 2024-03-10
context: "Our synchronous order processing pipeline was becoming a bottleneck. Long-running operations blocked the checkout flow, and failures in downstream services caused cascading issues."
decision: "Migrate order processing to an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka"
alternatives:
  - option: "Optimize existing synchronous flow"
    pros:
      - "No architectural changes required"
      - "Team already familiar with the codebase"
      - "Lower risk"
    cons:
      - "Doesn't solve the fundamental coupling problem"
      - "Still vulnerable to downstream failures"
      - "Limited scalability improvements"
  - option: "Use a simple message queue (RabbitMQ/SQS)"
    pros:
      - "Simpler than Kafka"
      - "Easier to operate"
      - "Good enough for basic async processing"
    cons:
      - "No event replay capability"
      - "Limited retention"
      - "Harder to add new consumers later"
  - option: "Use Kafka for event streaming"
    pros:
      - "Event replay for debugging and recovery"
      - "Easy to add new consumers"
      - "High throughput and durability"
      - "Natural audit log"
    cons:
      - "Operational complexity"
      - "Learning curve for the team"
      - "Eventual consistency challenges"
reasoning: "Kafka's event log model provides capabilities we'll need as we grow: replay for debugging, easy addition of new consumers, and a natural audit trail. The operational complexity is manageable with modern tooling, and the team is ready to level up their distributed systems skills."

## The Breaking Point

Our checkout flow was doing too much synchronously:
1. Validate inventory
2. Process payment
3. Update inventory
4. Send confirmation email
5. Notify warehouse
6. Update analytics

If any step failed or was slow, the entire checkout failed. During Black Friday, payment provider latency caused a 30% checkout failure rate.

## Event-Driven Design

We redesigned around events:

```
Order Placed → [Kafka] → Multiple Consumers
                         ├── Inventory Service
                         ├── Payment Service
                         ├── Notification Service
                         ├── Warehouse Service
                         └── Analytics Service
```

Each consumer processes independently. Failures are isolated and retried without affecting the user.

## Implementation Challenges

**Eventual Consistency**: Users might see "order placed" before inventory is updated. We added optimistic UI updates and clear status indicators.

**Idempotency**: Consumers must handle duplicate events. We implemented idempotency keys for all operations.

**Monitoring**: Distributed tracing became essential. We invested heavily in observability.

## Results

- Checkout success rate: 99.7% (up from 94%)
- Average checkout time: 800ms (down from 3.2s)
- Black Friday handled 3x previous peak with no issues
- New features (fraud detection, loyalty points) added without touching checkout code

The migration took 4 months but fundamentally improved our system's resilience.
