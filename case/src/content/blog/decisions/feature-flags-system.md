title: "Implementing Feature Flags for Safer Deployments"
description: "Implementation of feature flags using LaunchDarkly to enable safer deployments, gradual rollouts, instant kill switches, and A/B testing capabilities."
type: decision
publishDate: 2023-11-08
context: "Our deployment process was all-or-nothing. New features went live to all users immediately upon deployment, making rollbacks disruptive and limiting our ability to test in production."
decision: "Implement a feature flag system using LaunchDarkly for gradual rollouts and instant kill switches"
alternatives:
  - option: "Build custom feature flag system"
    pros:
      - "Full control over implementation"
      - "No external dependency"
      - "No per-seat licensing costs"
    cons:
      - "Significant development effort"
      - "Need to build targeting, analytics, UI"
      - "Maintenance burden on the team"
  - option: "Use LaunchDarkly"
    pros:
      - "Battle-tested at scale"
      - "Rich targeting capabilities"
      - "Built-in analytics and experimentation"
      - "Good SDK support"
    cons:
      - "Monthly cost (~$500/month for our scale)"
      - "External dependency"
      - "Data leaves our infrastructure"
  - option: "Use environment variables"
    pros:
      - "Simple to implement"
      - "No external dependencies"
    cons:
      - "Requires redeployment to change"
      - "No gradual rollout capability"
      - "No user targeting"
reasoning: "The cost of LaunchDarkly is justified by the development time saved and the risk reduction from gradual rollouts. Building a comparable system in-house would take months and require ongoing maintenance. The ability to instantly disable problematic features without redeployment is invaluable."

## The Problem

Our deployment anxiety was high:
- Every deploy was a potential incident
- Rollbacks required full redeployment (5-10 minutes)
- No way to test features with subset of users
- Product couldn't run A/B tests

## Feature Flag Strategy

We established patterns for flag usage:

**Release Flags**: Temporary flags for new features
```typescript
if (flags.isEnabled('new-checkout-flow', user)) {
  return newCheckoutFlow();
}
return legacyCheckoutFlow();
```

**Ops Flags**: Permanent flags for operational control
```typescript
if (flags.isEnabled('enable-cache', { service: 'api' })) {
  return cachedResponse();
}
```

**Experiment Flags**: For A/B testing
```typescript
const variant = flags.getVariant('pricing-test', user);
return pricingPages[variant];
```

## Rollout Process

New features now follow this process:

1. Deploy with flag disabled (0%)
2. Enable for internal users (dogfooding)
3. Enable for 1% of users, monitor
4. Gradually increase: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
5. Remove flag after feature is stable

## Results

- **Deployment frequency**: 3x increase (less fear)
- **Incident recovery time**: 90% reduction (instant kill switch)
- **A/B tests run**: 12 in first quarter (previously 0)
- **Developer confidence**: Significantly improved

The $500/month cost has paid for itself many times over in reduced incident impact and faster iteration.

## Lessons Learned

- **Flag hygiene matters**: We schedule flag cleanup to avoid technical debt
- **Default to off**: New flags should be disabled by default
- **Document flag purpose**: Every flag needs an owner and expiration date
