## Introduction

After five years of being on-call across different organizations—from startups to large enterprises—I've learned that incident management is as much about people and processes as it is about technology.

This post shares practical lessons on building incident response that actually works, reducing mean time to recovery (MTTR), and creating an on-call culture that doesn't burn out your team.

## The Anatomy of Effective Incident Response

### Severity Levels That Make Sense

Most teams overcomplicate severity levels. Here's a simple framework that works:

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Example |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| SEV1 | Complete service outage | Immediate | Payment system down |
| SEV2 | Major feature degraded | 15 minutes | Search returning errors |
| SEV3 | Minor impact | 1 hour | Slow dashboard loading |
| SEV4 | No user impact | Next business day | Internal tool issue |

The key insight: **severity is about user impact, not technical complexity**. A simple bug affecting all users is higher severity than a complex issue affecting none.

### The First 5 Minutes

The first five minutes of an incident determine its trajectory. Here's what should happen:

```markdown
1. Alert fires → On-call acknowledges (< 1 min)
2. Quick assessment: Is this real? What's the blast radius?
3. Decide: Can I fix this alone, or do I need help?
4. If SEV1/SEV2: Start incident channel, page additional help
5. Communicate: Post initial status update
```

I've seen teams waste 20+ minutes figuring out who should be involved. Pre-define escalation paths for common scenarios.

## Reducing MTTR: What Actually Works

### Runbooks That Get Used

Most runbooks are write-only documents. Here's how to make them useful:

**Bad runbook:**
```
If the database is slow, check the queries and optimize them.
```

**Good runbook:**
```markdown
## Symptom: Database latency > 500ms

### Quick diagnosis (< 2 min)
1. Check active connections: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;`
   - Normal: < 100
   - Problem: > 200

2. Check for long-running queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE state != 'idle'
   ORDER BY duration DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

### Common fixes
- **Too many connections**: Restart the connection pooler
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout restart deployment/pgbouncer
  ```
- **Long-running query**: Kill it (if safe)
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<pid>);
  ```

### Escalation
If not resolved in 15 min, page @database-team

The difference: specific commands, expected values, and clear escalation paths.

### Observability for Incidents

During an incident, you need answers fast. Structure your observability around common questions:

```typescript
// What I want to know during an incident:
const incidentQueries = {
  // Is the problem getting worse or better?
  errorTrend: 'rate(http_errors_total[5m])',
  
  // When did this start?
  changePoint: 'changes(deployment_timestamp[1h])',
  
  // What's affected?
  affectedEndpoints: 'topk(10, sum by (endpoint) (http_errors_total))',
  
  // Is it one bad actor or widespread?
  errorsByUser: 'sum by (user_id) (http_errors_total)',
};
```

Build dashboards that answer these questions with one click, not five minutes of query writing.

## Building Sustainable On-Call

### The On-Call Contract

Every team should have an explicit on-call contract:

```markdown
## On-Call Expectations

**Response time:**
- SEV1: Acknowledge within 5 minutes
- SEV2: Acknowledge within 15 minutes
- SEV3+: Next business day

**Compensation:**
- $X per week of on-call
- Time off after incidents (1 hour off per hour of incident)

**Support:**
- Never expected to fix alone—escalation is encouraged
- No blame for pages during off-hours
- Secondary on-call for backup

**Boundaries:**
- No on-call during PTO
- Maximum 1 week per month
- Quiet hours: 10pm-7am (SEV1 only)
```

Making expectations explicit prevents burnout and resentment.

### Reducing Alert Fatigue

Alert fatigue is the silent killer of on-call effectiveness. Here's how to fight it:

**The 80/20 rule for alerts:**
- 80% of pages should be actionable
- If you're ignoring alerts, delete them

**Weekly alert review:**
```markdown
## Alert Review - Week of Jan 15

| Alert | Pages | Actionable | Action |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| High CPU | 12 | 2 | Raise threshold to 90% |
| Disk space | 8 | 8 | Keep |
| API latency | 15 | 3 | Add auto-scaling |
| Memory leak | 1 | 1 | Keep |

**Decision:** Delete High CPU alert, implement auto-scaling for API
```

### The Blameless Postmortem

Postmortems are where learning happens—or doesn't. Here's a template that works:

```markdown
## Incident: Payment Processing Outage
**Date:** 2024-08-15
**Duration:** 47 minutes
**Severity:** SEV1
**Author:** [Name]

### Summary
Payment processing was unavailable for 47 minutes due to a 
database connection pool exhaustion caused by a query regression 
in the latest deployment.

### Timeline
- 14:23 - Deployment completed
- 14:31 - First customer report
- 14:35 - Alert fired, on-call paged
- 14:42 - Root cause identified
- 14:58 - Rollback completed
- 15:10 - Full recovery confirmed

### Root Cause
A new query in the checkout flow was missing an index, causing 
connections to be held for 30+ seconds instead of <100ms.

### What Went Well
- Quick identification of root cause
- Rollback process worked smoothly
- Customer communication was timely

### What Could Be Improved
- Query performance wasn't caught in code review
- No load testing for the new feature
- Alert fired 8 minutes after first customer report

### Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Add query performance CI check | @backend | 2024-08-22 |
| Implement synthetic monitoring | @sre | 2024-08-29 |
| Review alert thresholds | @on-call | 2024-08-18 |
```

The key: focus on **systems**, not people. "The deployment process allowed a slow query" not "John deployed a slow query."

## Incident Communication

### Internal Communication

During an incident, over-communicate:

```markdown
## Incident Update Template

**Status:** Investigating | Identified | Monitoring | Resolved
**Impact:** [Who is affected and how]
**Current action:** [What we're doing right now]
**Next update:** [When to expect the next update]

Example:
---
🔴 **Status:** Identified
**Impact:** ~30% of checkout attempts failing
**Current action:** Rolling back deployment v2.3.4
**Next update:** 10 minutes or when resolved
```

### External Communication

For customer-facing incidents:

**Do:**
- Acknowledge quickly, even if you don't have details
- Use plain language, not technical jargon
- Provide regular updates, even if nothing changed
- Share what you're doing to prevent recurrence

**Don't:**
- Blame third parties (even if it's their fault)
- Promise specific resolution times
- Over-explain technical details
- Disappear after resolution

## Measuring Incident Response

### Metrics That Matter

Track these metrics monthly:

```typescript
const incidentMetrics = {
  // How often are we having incidents?
  incidentCount: 'count by severity',
  
  // How quickly do we respond?
  timeToAcknowledge: 'median time from alert to acknowledgment',
  
  // How quickly do we fix things?
  timeToResolve: 'median time from alert to resolution',
  
  // Are we learning?
  repeatIncidents: 'incidents with same root cause as previous',
  
  // Is on-call sustainable?
  pagesPerWeek: 'average pages per on-call shift',
};
```

### Trending in the Right Direction

Good incident management shows:
- Decreasing incident count over time
- Stable or decreasing MTTR
- Low repeat incident rate (< 10%)
- Sustainable page volume (< 2 per night)

## Lessons Learned

After hundreds of incidents, here's what I know for sure:

1. **Preparation beats reaction**. Time invested in runbooks and automation pays off 10x during incidents.
2. **Communication is half the battle**. Most incident stress comes from uncertainty, not the technical problem.
3. **Blameless culture is non-negotiable.** The moment people fear blame, they stop reporting issues and sharing learnings.
4. **On-call sustainability matters.** Burned-out engineers make worse decisions and leave the company.
5. **Every incident is a gift.** It's a free stress test of your systems and processes. Learn from it.

## Conclusion

Incident management isn't about preventing all failures—that's impossible. It's about responding effectively when failures happen, learning from them, and building systems (both technical and human) that improve over time.

The best incident response teams I've worked with share one trait: they treat incidents as opportunities to improve, not as failures to hide.
