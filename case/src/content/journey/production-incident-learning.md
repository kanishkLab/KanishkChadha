## What Happened

I deployed a change that looked safe—a small optimization to a database query. It passed code review, passed tests, and worked fine in staging.

In production, under real load, it caused a cascade of failures that took down the checkout flow for 45 minutes during peak hours.

## The Aftermath

The blameless postmortem revealed several gaps:

- Our staging environment didn't reflect production load patterns
- The query worked fine for small datasets but degraded exponentially
- We lacked proper circuit breakers
- Our alerting was too slow

## How It Changed Me

This incident fundamentally changed how I approach code:

**I think about failure modes first.** What happens when this fails? What's the blast radius?

**I test with realistic data.** Small test datasets hide performance problems.

**I deploy incrementally.** Feature flags and gradual rollouts are non-negotiable.

**I invest in observability.** If you can't see it, you can't fix it.

The incident was painful, but I'm grateful for the lessons. I've prevented similar issues many times since by applying what I learned that day.
